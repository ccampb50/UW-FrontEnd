          Hello all my name is Craig Campbell and I work at Ford Motor Company 
          as a Software Engineer in their Big Data Environment. I recently obtained 
          my Bachelor's degree in Data Science and Analytics from Eastern Michigan 
          Univsertiy in Ypsilanti Michigan. Some of my favorite things to do are 
          watching tv and movies, playing and listening to music, and hanging out with
          people. I also like to play all sorts of video games!
